Lines 9-26 are the big box plot comparing the seedling counts across invasion levels
Lines 30-43 are the big box plot comparing the seedbank density across invasion levels
lines 46-59 is a box plot of just the low invasion seedbank density
lines 63-72 are the linear model I ran that is incorrect/not usable
lines 75-78 is the wilcox test I ran to test if the low invasion sites are different than the no invasion sites (if we could reject a null hypothe sis of 0)
lines 81-90 are not useful
lines 93-101 is the linear model I ran but it was the wrong data
lines 104-112 is the IMPORTANT linear regression as it compares the relationship between the seedbank density and the aboveground plant cover at each site
lines 115-122 is the scatterplot I made to represent the IMPORTANT linear model
